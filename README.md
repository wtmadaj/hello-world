# hello-world
My first repository

I'm new to GitHub and programming/development. I'm working towards a BS in IT
and hope to start a career doing coding and development of some kind. Here are
some of the languages I've learned so far:
HTML
CSS
C
C++
Python

I look forward to contributing as my career progresses!
